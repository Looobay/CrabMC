Also guys if you see something wrong in the code about the Minecraft EULA please tell me.

## Why does this project exist?

* Because I like Rust.
* Because I like Minecraft.
* Because I heard Minecraft was slow and wanted to fix it in the server-side code (I'm a clown by the way).

## What is the goal of the project?

* To replace the vanilla Minecraft server.
* To be a blazing fast software!

## What are the features of the project now?

* 游릭: Create eula.txt and server.properties (EULA is mandatory to respect the Mojang license).
* 游릭: Manage logs (it was a pain).
* 游릭: Manage handshake package.
* 游리: Manage connection packages (do not handle Mojang authentication).
* 游댮: Manage game packages.
* 游댮: Generate the world.
* 游댮: And the others things... (yes it's a big project)
